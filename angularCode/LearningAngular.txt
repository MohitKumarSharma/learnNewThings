:/id is a place holder for route parameter

paramMap is observable, so whener params change it redid the code. reset the value.

Optional param: Its optional. This does not affect the view. Just read it throuh route and
acivate reoute parammeter and using params get the values. so some process and show.
Activate route parameter
Router

Relative nagatic
route : it has relativeTo. that method have some overlaoded use that 
read about router and activateRouter.

childRoutes add it in appRoutes and inside is parent route add as childred
<router-outlet> componenant to show it on . It seems like palceholder.

rx js 5 to 6 is major changes

Service change

ngModelChange event

ng update/add
ng material.

How we can see

Which server angualr use?

Component: IT is fundamental base of apps. It shows ui to user, and interact with user take input and take 
action based on that.

As part of initial app, first component is app componenant.
Check about how to write test cases in angular.

Component:
Decorator: We have attached metadata in the form decorator.
It tells it is not simple class its decorator.
component: class + decorator + template which represent the view.

DI as framework
Sra,
Define service class
register with inject
declare as dependency
using provider metadata, can be used any where.

How we are going to approach.
Stick to the plan. Be confident.
Read in company, say if you dont understand, dont be more intellignet. Be what you are
say if you dont understand. Ask Anmol, if possible we can do kt after lunch.
did not get much time for study say that.

Study in office new framework. If you get the time.
Will try at here also. It is new tech will have to give time

This is the one good way to stop all the threads at checkpoint

CyclicBarrier class does that.
CyclicBarrier cyclicBarrier = new CyclicBarrier(3, ()->  {System.out.println("Stopped for refilling");});
		
		Biker mohit = new Biker("Mohit", cyclicBarrier);
		Biker aniketh = new Biker("Aniketh", cyclicBarrier);
		Biker parag = new Biker("Parag", cyclicBarrier);
		
		
public void run() {
		try {
			System.out.println(this.name + " has left Rampur");
			this.barrier.await();
			
			System.out.println(this.name + " has reached first checkpoint Mathura");
			
			this.barrier.await();
			
			System.out.println(this.name + " has reached first checkpoint ahmadnagr");
			
			this.barrier.await();
			
			System.out.println(this.name + " has reached destination pune");
			
		} 
		
This is the good concept which can be used.

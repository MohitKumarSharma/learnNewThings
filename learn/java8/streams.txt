List<person> ll = new ArrayList();

Average age of person who is less that 20

first mapping means in put list<Person> and return List<Integer> (ages of people).

Second step is filter
It takes List<Integer> and returns the List<Integer>. may be less element as filtered out.
predicate


Reduce : This the reduction operation equivalent ot SQL aggregation.


What is steams:

It is typed interface

public interface Stream<T> extends BaseStream<T, Stream<T>> {
}

Stream is efficient to process large amount of data.

Efficiently means:
Parallel processing  to leaverage computing power of multicore cpu.
PipeLined: to avoid unnecessary intermediary computation.

What is stream?
An Object on which operation can be defined.
Steam does not hold any data.
An Object able to process the data in one pass means like map reduce filter all in one pass.

Consumer chaining

Consumeer<String> c3 = c.andThen(c2);

ll.stream().filter(person -> person.getAge() > 20);

It filter takes predicate method.

Predicate<String> p = Predicate.isEqual("two");

Sream<String> st1 = Stream.of("one", "two");


Stream<String> st2 = st1.filter(p1);

Back To consumer
An Operation on a stream that returns a new stream is called intermediary operation
All the method that returns stream  are lazy


person.stream().peek(System.out.println()).filter(person.getAge() > 20).peek();

What does this function do, it does nothing because all the operation is intermediary operation as stream are lazy this will do nothing.

forEach is final oepratin as it does not returns any things.

Int the java8 we have 

Instant class 
Which is instant on timeline.

It immutable class

Instant = Instant.now();

Second key concept
Duration class

It is the amount of time between two instant object.

there are muliple mehtod on this class.

duration.toMillise() erric

plusNannos

3rd concept is localDate:
why this it is becase instant has depth to nanno level management but some time we dont have nano level infor so we can use localDate.
LocalDate localDate = LocalDate.now();

LocalDate lc = LocalDate.of(1564, Month.APRIL, 10);

Period: is same concept as Duration but here we dont go to nano level.

Period p = lc.until(now);
p.getYear(); // to get years from then 	

long days = lc.until(now, Chronounit.Days); // number of days

DateAdjuster:

LocalDate now = LocalDate.of(2019, Monght.APRIL, 24);
LocalDate nextSunday = now.with(TemporalAdjusters.next(DaysOfWeek.SUNDAY));

6th Conceput
LocalTime is the when you ask your friend to meet at lunch at 1pm.
LocalTime lt = LocalTime.now();
LocalTime lt = LocalTime.of(10, 20); // 10:20 am

many tmehtod 
lt.plusHours(8);

Lst conceput is 
ZonedTime:
ZoneDateTime zdt = ZoneDateTime.of(1564, Month.APRIL, 10, 10,0,0,0, ZonedId.of("Europe/london"));

zdt.plus(Period.Month);

To change timezone.withSameZoneTimeInstant(ZoneIf.of("US/Central"));

DateTimeFormatter is a class which format the date.
DateTimeFormatter.ISO_DATE_TIME.format(zdt); 2014-04-11T03:00:00-00:00[US-Central ]
DateTimeFormatter.RFS_1123_DATE.format(zdt); 12 april 2014...


Api to legacy
Date date  = Date.from(instant);
Instant date = date.toInstant();

abot fro TimeStamp, LocalDate also

And also LocalTime

ZoneDateTime ustTime = zdt.

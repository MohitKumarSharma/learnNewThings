I am not person who switched a job every year. I gave this company 5 year, because of work i am planning.
When i am switching job, Now i will think both work and money, as you have a good work and culture, parallely need a good money.

If you see some of my colleague who switched in these 2 - 3 times and reached on this figure. Its not that they are intelligent than me.

As you said, when i asked 25plus, you said it all depends on the interview, and I think i did good in interview, I answered most of the questions.

We will do shortest path

Overlapping means same problem is solved again and again.
n -, n -1 problems solve again and again.

OptimalSubstructre: If we can build a solution of larger problem by using subproblem, then it is called optimal substrure
fib[n] = fib[n - 1] + fib[n - 2];

Then this case we can say optimal substructure

FloyedWarshal
BellmanFord are typical example

Shrotest path


Its some king of similar divide and conquer problem, but in divide and conquer(Its optimal substructure problem) same problem does not repeat.
In dp problem on addinal propery overlapping subproblem means same problem is solved multiple problem. instead solving again and again we can store that solution and use it later.

Certain problem recursin is much easier to read and understand then iterative solutino

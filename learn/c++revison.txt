C++ is a statically typed, compiled, general-purpose, case-sensitive, free-form programming language that supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming.

C++ is regarded as a middle-level language, as it comprises a combination of both high-level and low-level language features.

C++ is a superset of C, and that virtually any legal C program is a legal C++ program.

C++ is being highly used to write device drivers and other software that rely on direct manipulation of hardware under realtime constraints.

The size of variables might be different from those shown in the above table, depending on the compiler and the computer you are using.

   cout << "Size of int : " << sizeof(int) << endl;
   cout << "Size of short int : " << sizeof(short int) << endl;

Check about glbal variable.

Reference to variable is alteernate to pointer.
it uses &

int b = 10;
int& a = b;

printlnf(a )// 10;
&a will  print address

check about why 
scanf("%c", &ch);

is not working as expected,.

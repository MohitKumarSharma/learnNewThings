OpenClosed Principle

We have give bonus to specific employee.
Contract employee
Each emply will have their own method of not giving bonus.


Whenver you see instanceof start thinking about design.

in this in starting HospitalManagement has all the type of work

and on the instance type we were calll the work for them.

How we can improve that design.

Idealy work functinality should be with employee class.

so all the works method goes in respecitve class.

in employee class we create one abtract method
performDuties

in Nurse class we will create

performDuties() {
	this.checkVitals()
	this.cleanFloor();
	//etch other works of nurse.
}

and from HospitalManagement 

class HospitalManagement {
	public void callUpon(Employee e) {
		e.performDuties();
	}
}

class EmergencyRoomProcess {
	psvm() {
		Doctor d = new Doctor();
		HospitalManagement hm = new HospitalManagement();
		
		hm.callUpon(d);
		hm.callUpon(n); // Also using stategy design pattern.
	}
}

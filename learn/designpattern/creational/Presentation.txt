What is design pattern

Type of design pattern
Creational desing pattern
Structural
Behavioural

Builder Design Pattern
Problem is solves:
Complext agument constructor.

Generally we see that some classes have a list of argument, in that some times some argument are optional. we dont know
which one.


Typically it is used when we want to create immutable object. once it is create we dont want to change.
Immutable Object



Give example StringBuilder
Added in 1.5
earlier we used to 
each time concatentation of string, creating object each time with new string.

Now we have StringBuilder which is used to build StringBuilder

There are muliple method/flexibility it provides, to build string
like
append 
prepent
with some arumented constructor.

when you are done with feeding your requirement to stringBulder call

toString() method on stringBuilder
return new String(value, 0, count);
which is like build will return a string.


Using setter 
Drawaback

It can't be immutable as after creating object we use setters.
Issue with it does not have contract what is lunch order is.
means
Meal meal = new Meal();
event without calling lunch order it will work.


Using constructor
I can have immutable object,
but issue with this is How you can feed the constructor subset of fields.
if does not daal, or veg , in that a lot of constructor is required.

Now next we come to the next which is best of both above approach.


Generally
Immutable
inner static class

Constructor and creation of object
Few drwaback repeate code.
can refactored in sepeate class

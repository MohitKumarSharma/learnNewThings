Decouple de

Bridge between abstraction and implementation class.

Both Abstraction and implementation should be extensible.

We need to implementation multple object.

In Bridge design 

Two different object going to solve one problem

There are two logical seperated entitiy.

Abstraction =>  which is used by client, it alos has reference of implementor.
Implementor =>  which is  used from inside the abstraction.

Abstraction 
Like

DrawApi {
	drawApi();
}

Red impmenets DrawApi {
	drawApi() {
		syso("abc");
	}
}

Implementor
Shape {
	Shape(DrawApi api) {
		this.api = api;
	}
	
	draw();
}

Circle extenbds Shape {
	Circle(x, y, drawPai) {
		supre(drawApi);
	}
	
	draw() {
		this.drawApi.drawApi();
	}
}

client {
	psvm() {
		DrawApi api = new RedApi();
		
		Circle circle = new Circle(5, 6, api);
		
		circle.draw();
	}
}

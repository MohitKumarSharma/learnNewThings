Adaptor Design pattern:
Mix two different interface.
to use same functionality.

It is used to combine two incompatible interface and giving kind of same function with more reusable
Adapter pattern works as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces. This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern combines the capability of two independent interfaces.

A single class which is responsible of two independent or incompatible objects/interfaces.

A real life example card reader/adapter which is used to help laptop to read data from memory card.


Interfaces may be incompatible, but the inner functionality should match the requirement.

The adapter pattern is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code.
Adapter patterns use a single class (the adapter class) to join functionalities of independent or incompatible interfaces/classes.

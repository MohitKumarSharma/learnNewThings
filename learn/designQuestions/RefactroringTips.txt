 When you find you have to add a feature to a program, and the program’s code is not structured in a convenient way to add the feature, first refactor the program to make it easy to add the feature, then add the feature.

 Regular refactoring helps code retain its shape.
 
 Two of the first people to recognize the importance of refactoring were Ward Cunningham and Kent Beck, who worked with Smalltalk from the 1980s onward.

 . Polymorphism is better because the caller does not need to know about the conditional behavior, and it is thus easier to extend the conditions. As a result, object-oriented programs rarely have switch (case) statements. Any that show up are prime candidates for Replace Conditional with Polymorphism (255).

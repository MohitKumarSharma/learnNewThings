Alice does a tweets

hits the loadbalancer

Issue with relational databases is
Select all tweets from all followed person by alice and put it in chornonolgical order.

This query will break the system if followed person is huge. Because of this we can go in memory base data redis and also other for like document based
data base.

once used does a tweets, it preevalute the profile of all the follower person at that time.
Issue with whatif justin beiber or lady gaga tweets, thy have millions of user.

in that cases that type of profiles tweets will be added in the user profile at the time of browsing by user.

to see which redis we will use hashing to find the index of redis of user.

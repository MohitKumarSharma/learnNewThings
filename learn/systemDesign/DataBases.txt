Sql  is structured query language

NOSQL: Key value pair based: reddis, dynamoc
document based: Mongo db, mars db
Wide Column database: columnar, column family, not all column needed upfront, exmaple cassandra and HBase
Graph DataBase: Infintie graph


Most of the NoSQL solutions sacrifice ACID compliance for performance and scalability.

SQL: Veritcal callable: for distriuting this db its very challenching task
No SQL: Horrizontal scalable: Some of the db itself probive distribution.

Load Balancing:
Avoid single point of failure.

Health Checks - Load balancers should only forward traffic to “healthy” backend servers. 


Two design question have to study:
Parking lot,
Type ahead problem.
Threading questions.

Weighted Round Robin Method:

Clusture of loadBalance to handle single point of failure.


Type ahead search:

DataBase:


Traversak tree without recursion all type of
Inorder: done
Preorder: done
Inorder: done


HeapSort, write it.
Designing backup systems: 
Threading: 
Sorting a huge file: See the code and implement:
Code we have to see
sorting done.

function courseSoruceProvider(http: Httpclient) {
	return new CourseProvider(http);
}

injection token is unique identifier, each dependency has unique token
COURSE_SOURCE = new InjectionToken<CourseSource>('COURCE_SORUCE');


when we do in constructour

constructour(@inject(COURCE_SORUCE) private courseSource: CourseSource)



We need to place request of create instance of dependency using token. that;s why we @Inect COURCE_SORUCE
@Component/or moduel class


providers: [
	{
		provide: COURCE_SORUCE,
		useFactory: courseSoruceProvider,
		deps: [Httpclient]
	}
]

every dependency has unique injection token, and have provide factory function.
angular also does the same thing di.

Jit vs aot compiler.
vendor contains the compler

npm install -g source-map-explorer
install the package to see the visualization
node_module\.bin\source-map-explorer dist\\vendor.js

See later

ng serve 
we by default get jit compilation

ng serve --aot true
ng serve --prod

With jit, browser need to download angular compilation also.
but aot compiler this is not needed.

With Jit, to compile the script first time user has to wait.
but aot as files are precompiled, no need to wait


With jit, template errors are captured at runtime at browser while
aot , these are captured at build time itself

By default both uses jit
ng build
ng serve

we can enable by config option

ng serve --aot

ng serve --prod
default compiler for productin is aot

accordian 
hiding click on headeer

downside strictlly attached to component not reusable

create css style 

.pointerCustor {
	cursor: pointer
}

take varialbe
panelExpanded = true
;

binded to body and footer of panel div

use ngIf directive to render div or not. It removes the dom element completely if panelexpanded ngif direct false.

instead of remove adding dom complete from dom we can show or hide body and footer of panel

we use 
[hidden]="isHidden" property binding.


difference beween hidden property *ngIf directive
ngIf directive remove the dome
while hidden jsut change display: to none means hide and show.

Creating according using ng-content becuase it make generic.

panel
header ng-content
body ng-content
footer ng-content

multi slot content-projection.

(click)="isHidden = !isHidden"


after writing generic compnent using ng-content
we need to pass the data.

for titlw and other realted we use property binding

ng-content place holder we will use class selector
<ng-content select=".myPanelFooter"></ng-content>

now footer div
<div class="myPanelFooter" ></div>

We can use any of css selector for content projection
